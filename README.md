# WFQ Packet Scheduler Simulation
This repository contains a simulation of Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) implemented in Python. WFQ is a queue scheduling algorithm used in routers and switches to allocate bandwidth to different network traffic flows based on their assigned weights.

## Code Description

The code simulates the WFQ process in four main components:

* Packet Generation: It generates packets randomly to simulate network traffic. The packets have features such as source and destination addresses, size, and traffic type.

* Packet Classification: It classifies the packets into multiple queues based on their assigned weights. Each queue has a relative priority based on its weight.

* Packet Transmission: It sends the classified packets according to a specific transmission algorithm. The order and quantity of packets sent from each queue may vary depending on the implementation.

* Packet Reception and Ordering: It simulates the reception of packets and orders them based on criteria such as queue priority or arrival time.

The code is executed through the simulate_wfq(num_packets) function, where num_packets is the number of packets to generate and simulate.

## Requirements

The code requires Python 3 and the following library:

* random: Used for generating random numbers.

## Usage

* Clone the repository or download the files to your local system.

* Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

* Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository directory.

* Run the following command to start the simulation:

```
python app.py
```

* Enter the number of packets you want to generate when prompted.

* Observe the output showing packet reception.
